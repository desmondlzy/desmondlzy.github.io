      <description>&lt;p&gt;I will use this article as my weaponry for all the goodies I come across during my academic journey.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s going to be a curated list of software, tutorials, advice and many other things that I find particularly useful and would like to share with everyone reading this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I know this is not going to be anywhere near exhaustive, but I&amp;rsquo;ll try my best to keep it refreshed.&#xA;So, please come back now and then, or give me some suggestions for additions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Workflow: Why Vim, Why Not</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of summarizing the research coding workflow I use now into a couple of blog posts here.&#xA;Hopefully by having a moment of reflection and writing, I can get a better understanding of how I do things and perhaps even give people some cool ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the very first one in the sequel is gonna be about editors.&#xA;This topic apparently sometimes can get really controversial, so I&amp;rsquo;ll be just focusing on my personal experience and feelings of&#xA;how me using my personal favorite coding tools changes my coding mindsets, and alleviates my pain from the repetitive coding tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>7x24 Automatically Submit Thousands of Jobs to CSE GPGPU Cluster</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit (Nov 7 2024):&lt;/strong&gt; This post was written back in 2020 at CUHK. Things might have changed a lot and the article might be very obsolete now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a machine learning project, so it comes inevitable to do some time-eating finetuning tasks. Obviously, it would be infeasible to tune thousands of combinations of hyperparameters all on my laptop.&#xA;As a result, I turn to CSE&amp;rsquo;s GPGPU computing cluster, hoping their TITANs can help. The computational power is great, but meanwhile, it&amp;rsquo;s also quite underwhelming as they put a very annoying limit for the users â€”&lt;/p&gt;</description>
