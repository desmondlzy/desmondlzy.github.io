excerpt: "About Me..."
---

I am an undergrad in [Department of Computer Science and Engineering][cse-web] at [the Chinese University of Hong Kong][cuhk-web]. I am expected to finish my BSc. in Computer Science in June 2021. Check my [resume][my-resume] for more information. 
I am also with Tencent as a backend engineer intern, starting January 2021.

### Research Projects

My research interest lies in the intersection of computer graphics and machine learning.

Currently, I am working with [Prof. Fu Chi Wing][philip-web], on a project in the field of fabrication. We are studying a new way to analyze the stress over a multi-joint assembly, and optimization of its structural rigidity.

In year 2020, I received Professor Charles Kao Scholarship and worked with [Prof. Anand Sarwate][anand-web] at Rutgers University, on computation efficient neural networks. Before that, I've also explored another research topic on NLP with [Prof. Michael Lyu][michael-web].

### Side Projects

I like to work on personal projects on the side, for the maximized freedom there I have to 'hack' 
(~~break things without getting burned~~; 
~~write no documentation~~; ~~use no Java~~). 
Check them out through the links and please consider to give a star on GitHub if you find any one of them interesting.
