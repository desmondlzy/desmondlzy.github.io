excerpt: "About Me..."
---

I am an undergraduate student in [Department of Computer Science and Engineering][cse-web], [the Chinese University of Hong Kong][cuhk-web]. I am expected to finish my BSc. in Computer Science in 2021. Check my [resume][my-resume] for more information.

### Research Experience

Starting from my first year in CUHK, I have been working on different research topics.

In the summer of 2019, I, together with my partner Yuxiao Qu, did an NLP research project, advised by [Prof. Michael Lyu][michael-web]. We tried to devise a black-box method to attack state-of-the-art text classification models. In the end of that summer, our project was awarded *Best Project* by the faculty.

In my third year of study, I received Professor Charles Kao Scholarship and worked with [Prof. Anand Sarwate][anand-web] at Rutgers University.
We focused on that using a computationally inexpensive classifier such as SVM on data in an intermediate layer to do binary classification, and therefore save the computation.

Right now, I am working with [Prof. Fu Chi Wing][philip-web] and his PhD student [Xu Hao][xuhao-web], on a project in the field of computational design.

### Side Projects

Despite heavy school work, I always try to spare some time working on my personal projects, trying out interesting thoughts and ideas. Click on those links for details and star them on GitHub if you find them interesting.

- [TimeWalk][timewalk-core]: Get your coding metrics! [VSCode plugin][timewalk-vscode] available!
- [Slurmmy][slurmmy-github]: Automated slurm jobs submission. [blog post][slurmmy-intro-en]
- Spaghettify: Drastically *decrease* the readability of your Python code. (Ongoing)
